This script receives a newline separated list of major/minor versions on its
stdin and produces a JSON list of major/minor versions.

The returned list will only contain the latest minor release for each major
release.

This is used in the CI scripts to create a buildmatrix that contains the latest
minors of the last 3 to 4 majors.
